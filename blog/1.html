  <h2>A philosopher reads SICP</h2>
  <h4>2022-10-24 Mon</h4>
  <div id="main">
    <p>
      Last June I finally completed my phd in philosophy. Some weeks before
      my graduation, it was clear to me that I would have not continued with
      academic philosophy. Instead I would have tried to find a job as a
      programmer. Lucky to be assisted by the right persons, I found one
      pretty quickly. I happily write software full time now.
    </p>

    <p>
      My programming journey began in 2015 with the great Harvard's CS50x.
      Since then I have consistently allocated some time to learn the
      fundamentals of programming and of computer science. I am, though,
      still far from an acceptable understanding of the discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last week I bought a physical copy of the Wizard Book. Yes, the
      legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, aka
      SICP, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. The
      original one; the one in LISP. I've already gone through some tough
      books and their exercises. <a href="https://github.com/pietroiusti/eloquent_javascript_third_edition">Eloquent JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pietroiusti/The_C_Programming_Language">K&amp;R</a> come to
      mind. SICP, however, is particularly intimidating, especially given
      its ``<a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/code-quarterly/2011/hal-abelson/">tremendous amount</a>'' of maths.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm intentioned to read it and do most of the exercises. I'm taking
      the occasion to start this blog; partly as a way to keep myself
      motivated. Like others in the past &#x2014; hey <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/sicp">Eli Bendersky</a>, what a
      story! &#x2014; I'll post my progress with the book.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems that many have failed along the path towards wizardry. Wish
      me luck.
